This source code is designed to teach the play framework 2 basics at play's training course lead by dijit.

We're very enthusiastic about play's way of doing server side service delivery.
We try to share some of the experience on play framework with the community here.

Today, we have some tutorials to share.
Those can be found in this repository, each one covering one aspect of the framework:
