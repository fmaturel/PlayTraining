# Step 1: Copy your previous project to keep your work history (optional)

If you want to keep your progress, you can copy the previous project. To do this simply :
- copy / paste into your IDE previous project by changing the project name
- change the name of your project in the "build.sbt" file
- in the newly created directory, run the command : 
```
activator eclipse
```

To retrieve the source code of the libraries used, use:
```
activator "eclipse with- source = true"
```

And voila, you have a new brand new project taking the old code.

# Step 2: Live edit the code
With what we have seen before, try changing the text "Your new implementation is ready.", that is visible on the home screen.
- Make it "Training Play! Framework..."
 
Note that you can access the documentation by clicking on the title.
